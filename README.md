# Arduino-Quadcopter
A stabilized quadcopter based on the arduino platform

# Abandonned
### Our testing reaveled that the common AVR ATmega328P found on arduino boards is not nearly powerful enough to support a complex flight computer program. We'we since moved to a STM32F103 bluepill board. New project found here: https://github.com/koebelt/STM32-Quadcopter
